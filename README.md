# Unofficial SwiftFormat Docker Image

![[CI status](https://ci.younata.com/teams/main/pipelines/other/jobs/swiftformat/)](https://ci.younata.com/api/v1/pipelines/other/jobs/swiftformat/badge)

Unofficial, automatically updated docker image of the latest [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/swiftformat) release.

This uses a concourse job to track the latest GitHub release of SwiftFormat, and then release a new docker image matching that tag.
